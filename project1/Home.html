            Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species.

        <h4>
            Coffee traces its origin to a genus of plants known as Coffea.  Within the genus there are over 500 genera and 6,000
            species of tropical trees and shrubs. Experts estimate that there are anywhere from 25 to 100 species of coffee plants.
            The genus was first described in the 18th century by the Swedish botanist, Carolus Linneaus, who also described Coffea 
            Arabica in his Species Plantarum in 1753. Botanists have disagreed ever since on the exact classification, since coffee 
            plants can range widely. They can be small shrubs to tall trees, with leaves from one to 16 inches in size,
            and in colors from purple or yellow to the predominant dark green.
